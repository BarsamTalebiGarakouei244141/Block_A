One milestone in the history of AI was the DSRPAI workshop hosted by Pr John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, in which Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herber Simon presented the Logical Theorist, a research program made to replicate human problem solving skills in computers. It was also at this workshop where the term AI was first used.
